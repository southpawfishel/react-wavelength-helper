# Wavelength Helper

An app for playing one of my favorite games, [Wavelength](https://wavelength.zone), in a browser while unable to safely play games with friends during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The game is intended to be played with all players on a video call together where no player is sharing their screen but all players have the client open in a browser window or on their mobile phone.

This repo contains the React frontend app as well as the game backend, written using Express.js, and the expectation is that the same server that's running the backend is also serving up the built React app.

## Running the game

First, build the app:

```sh
cd frontend
yarn build
```

Then build + run the server:

```sh
cd ../backend
yarn build && yarn start
```

This will run the server which will both listen for incoming websocket connections from the client to handle multiplayer game state sync, but also will host the static page generated by building the frontend.
